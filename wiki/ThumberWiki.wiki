*Thumber* is a small and simple to use PHP 5 class that automatically generates thumbnails of any size from PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs.


= How to install =

Download the latest version [http://code.google.com/p/phpthumbmaker/downloads/list here].

Upload it to your web server (PHP 5, GD library needed).

Create a directory for the thumbnails cache (see below).

= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply type an URL like this into your browser:

{{{http://yourserver.org/thumber.php?img=images/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has three parameters:

  * *img*: the path to the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail image
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail image

You can either specify the width (w), the height (w), or both. If you omit one value, it will automatically be calculated (BTW: this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails...). For future releases a 'fit tumbnail into a box' mode is planned - there are fragments of it in the code, but it's not yet functional.

= Caching =

Thumber stores each freshly created thumbnail image file in a directory - the default path to it is ./thumbs/', but you might easily change it within the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Quite obviously, this directory needs to be writeable.

The next time you call (or anybody else calls) thumber.php, it will automagically serve the cached thumbnail, saving precious computing time.

*Note:* Once you've replaced the original image, you'll have to manually delete the cached thumbnail, otherwise you'll be stuck with an old, wrong thumbnail - future releases might add this functionality  from within PHP.

Have fun!
