*Thumber* is a small and simple to use PHP 5 class that automatically generates thumbnails of any size from PNG, JPEG, and GIF images.


= How to install and use Thumber =

- Download the latest version [http://code.google.com/p/phpthumbmaker/downloads/list here].

- Upload it to your web server (PHP 5, GD library required).

- Create a directory for the thumbnails cache (see below).

= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply type an URL like this into your browser:

{{{http://yourserver.org/thumber.php?img=images/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has four parameters:

  * *img*: the path to the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail image
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail image
  * *a*: the desired area of the thumbnail image

You can either specify the width (w), the height (h), or both. If you omit one value, it will automatically be calculated for you (btw: this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails :-(  ).

Alternatetively, you can specify the desired area of the thumbnail: use e.g. 'a= 100000' to generate a thumbnail that covers an area of 100000 pixels; this makes sense if you have a lot of images with different aspect ratios - it 'evens out' their visual impacts.

For future releases a 'fit thumbnail into a box' mode is planned.

= Caching =

Thumber stores each freshly created thumbnail image file in a directory - the default path to it being ./thumbs/', but you can easily change it within the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Quite obviously, this directory needs to be writeable.

The next time you call (or anybody else calls) thumber.php, it will automagically serve the cached thumbnail, saving precious computing time.

*Note:* Once you've replaced an original image with another one of the same name, you'll have to manually delete the cached thumbnail as well, otherwise you'll be stuck with an old, wrong thumbnail - future releases might add this functionality from within PHP (see: 'New in version 0.5.6').

= New in version 0.5.4 =

- cleaned up code

- much faster caching (no more bad re-directing, but swift streaming through the connection)

- 'area mode' added

- added slight sharpening (thumbnails are now about as 'sharp' as the input image)

= New in version 0.5.6 =

- forces the creation of a new thumbnail if the creation date of the cached one is older than the orginalâ€™s modification date

- added alpha channel support for PNGs and GIFs

- parameters 'w' and 'h' - if both set - define a 'box' into which the thumbnail fits; the output of distorted images is no longer possible

- substituted an underscore with an 'x' in the thumbnail filename for better readability, e.g. 'example_160x257.png' instead of 'example_160_257.png'

- better error handling

- cleaned up the code, improved comments

= To do =

- cache purging through URL (GET parameter)

- add a JPEG quality (GET) parameter

- implement / finalize proper error handling

- auto detect presence of an alpha channel in the image
