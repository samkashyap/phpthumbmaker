*Thumber* is a small and simple to use PHP 5 class that automatically generates thumbnails of any size from PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs.


= How to install Thumber =

Download the latest version [http://code.google.com/p/phpthumbmaker/downloads/list here].

Upload it to your web server (PHP 5, GD library required).

Create a directory for the thumbnails cache (see below).

= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply type an URL like this into your browser:

{{{http://yourserver.org/thumber.php?img=images/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has three parameters:

  * *img*: the path to the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail image
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail image

You can either specify the width (w), the height (h), or both. If you omit one value, it will automatically be calculated for you (btw: this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails :-(  ). For future releases a 'fit tumbnail into a box' mode is planned - there are fragments of it in the code, but it's not yet functional.

= Caching =

Thumber stores each freshly created thumbnail image file in a directory - the default path to it is ./thumbs/', but you might easily change it within the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Quite obviously, this directory needs to be writeable.

The next time you call (or anybody else calls) thumber.php, it will automagically serve the cached thumbnail, saving precious computing time.

*Note:* Once you've replaced the original image you'll have to manually delete the cached thumbnail, otherwise you'll be stuck with an old, wrong thumbnail - future releases might add this functionality  from within PHP.

Have fun!
