#Thumber is small and simple to use PHP 5 class that automatically generates thumbnails of any size from PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs.

= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply type an URL like this into your browser:

{{{http://yourserver.org/thumber.php?img=assets/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has three parameters:

  * *img*: the path to the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail image
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail image

You can either specify the width, the height, or both. If you omit one value, the other one will automatically be calculated (this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails...). For future releases a 'fit tumbnail into a box' mode is planned - there are fragments of it in the code, but it's not yet functional.

= Caching =

Thumber caches each thumbnail in a directory. The default path is ./thumbs/', but you might change it in the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Of course, the direcory needs to be writeable.

The next time you call thumber.php, it will automagically serve you the cached thumbnail, thus saving time.

If you replace the orginal image, you'll have to delete the cached thumbnail manually, otherwise you'll get stuck with an old, wrong thumbnail - future releases might add a function to do so from within PHP.

Have fun!
