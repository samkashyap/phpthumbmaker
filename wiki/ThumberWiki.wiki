#Thumber is small and simple to use PHP class that automatically generates thumbails of any size out of PNGs, JPEGs, and GIFs.


= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply generate an URL like this:

{{{http://localhost/thumber.php?img=assets/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has three parameters:

  * *img*: the path yo the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail

You can either specify the width, the height, or both. If you omit one value, the other one will automatically be calculated (this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails...). For future releases a 'fit tumbnail into a box' mode is planned - there are fragments of it in the code, but it's not yet functional.

= Caching =

Thumber caches each thumbnail in a directory.

The default path is ./thumbs/', but you might change it in the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Of course, the direcory needs to be writeable.

Have fun!
