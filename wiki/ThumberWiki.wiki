*Thumber* is a small and simple to use PHP 5 class that automatically generates thumbnails of any size from PNG, JPEG, and GIF images.


= How to install Thumber =

Download the latest version [http://code.google.com/p/phpthumbmaker/downloads/list here].

Upload it to your web server (PHP 5, GD library required).

Create a directory for the thumbnails cache (see below).

= Usage =

To generate a thumbnail image, simply type an URL like this into your browser:

{{{http://yourserver.org/thumber.php?img=images/abc.png&h=200}}}

Thumber has four parameters:

  * *img*: the path to the original image
  * *w*: the desired width of the thumbnail image
  * *h*: the desired height of the thumbnail image
  * *a*: the desired area of the thumbnail image

You can either specify the width (w), the height (h), or both. If you omit one value, it will automatically be calculated for you (btw: this is the way to go in most cases, otherwise one easily ends up with distorted thumbnails :-(  ).

Alternatetively, you can specify the desired area of the thumbnail: use e.g. 'a= 100000' to generate thumbnail that covers an area of 100000 pixels; this makes sense if you have a lot of images with different aspect ratios - it 'evens out' the visual impact.

For future releases a 'fit thumbnail into a box' mode is planned.

= Caching =

Thumber stores each freshly created thumbnail image file in a directory - the default path to it being ./thumbs/', but you can easily change it within the code:

{{{define('PATH_TO_THUMBS', './thumbs/');}}}

Quite obviously, this directory needs to be writeable.

The next time you call (or anybody else calls) thumber.php, it will automagically serve the cached thumbnail, saving precious computing time.

*Note:* Once you've replaced an original image with another one of the same name, you'll have to manually delete the cached thumbnail as well, otherwise you'll be stuck with an old, wrong thumbnail - future releases might add this functionality from within PHP.

= New in version 0.5 =

- cleaned up code

- much faster caching (no more bad re-directing, but swift streaming through the connection)

- 'area mode' added

- added slight sharpening (thumbnails are now about as 'sharp' as the input image)
